## About this project
This is a playground project that builds up couple of microservices to support common features of nowadays e-commers systems. Features include product mangement, ordering management, inventory management, reviews management.

We will be using open source frameworks and infrastructures most of time but sometimes implement fundamental algorithms on our own, as this project is purely for learning purposes and fun.
